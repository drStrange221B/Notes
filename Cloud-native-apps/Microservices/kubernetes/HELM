Helm is widely know as the package manager for k8s. The goal of Helm was to provide users with a better way to manage
all the Kubernetes YAML files we create on Kubernetes projects.  

install helm
> brew install helm

From chocolatey (Windows)
> choco install kubernetes-helm

check version
> helm -version

create helm chart
> helm create <Helm chart Name>

Install chart into the helm
> helm install <give name for installation> <location where chart is created with chart name>

inside workload there will deployment and inside services there will be services created. The default 
service is limited inside the cluster. Inorder to expose the service to the outer client we need to 
create new service called Ingress. 

In Values.yml, 
ingress: 
  enabled: true 

To create the ingress service.

Upgrade Helm:
> helm upgrade <deployemnt-name> <chart-name>

Mapping of the Ingress hostname with ip address is necessary, inorder to expose the services to the external
world

Uninstall Helm
> helm uninstall <deploynment-name>
