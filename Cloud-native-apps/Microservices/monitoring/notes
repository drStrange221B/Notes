Different Approcaches to Monitor
1) Actuator: Actuator is mainly used to expose operational information about the running application health, metrics, info, dump, env, etc. 
  It uses HTTP endpoints or JMX beans to enable us to interact with it.
   
2) Micrometer: Micrometer automatically exposes /actuator/metrics data into something your monitoring system can understand. All you need to do 
  is include that vendor-specific micrometer dependency in your application. Think SLF4J, but for matrics
3) PROMETHEUS: It is a time-series database that stores our metric data by pulling it (using a built-in-data scraper) periodically over HTTP. It also 
   has simple user interface where we can visualize/query on all of the collected metrics.
4) GRAFANA: Grafana can pull data from various data sources like Prometheus and offers a rich UI where you can build up custom graphs quickly 
   and create a dashboard out of many graphs in no time. It also allows you to set rule-based alerts, for notifications.
